# Hi, I’m [Kevin Ngigi](https://www.kevin-ngigi.com) 👨🏽‍💻 👋🏼

I am a biologist who is interested in using computer science skills and Automation to solve problems that impact my life and can ease that of others.

This doesn't mean that I have given up on my being a Biologist, indeed, one can argue that I have become a better one by having the skillset that I do.
